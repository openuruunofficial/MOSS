moss_backend must be running before moss, or the latter will give up and
exit.


If you are on a system which may be renumbered, you can handle the renumbering
a couple of ways, depending on your requirements.
* If you are using a bind_address other than 0.0.0.0:
  You must restart moss so that it will use the new bind_address.
* If you have a DNS name and are listening on 0.0.0.0 (all addresses):
  You can set external_address to the DNS name and always_resolve to true. This
  causes moss to resolve external_address every time it is required. Thus the
  server will track renumbers as fast as the DNS. Note, existing connections
  will fail. It could take ~6 minutes for server state (i.e., running game
  servers) to clear after a renumbering event. Attempting to log in after a
  renumber while an old game server is running will result in a client hang
  when it can't connect to the old IP address.
* If you don't have a DNS name that changes when renumbered:
-or-
* If you don't want to do name resolution each gatekeeper request/game server:
  Leave always_resolve set to false and update external_address when the
  address changes. Reload the config file with kill -HUP. If you use a DNS name
  in external_address, make sure the DNS record is updated first. It is
  probably easier to set external_address to the IP address rather than a
  hostname (no DNS update lag to worry about).
  

The SDL mechanism depends on all servers in the shard having synchronized
time. Use NTP if you have more than one server. (You'll also need to NFS mount
the game/state directory on all the servers so the age SDL is available to
all.)


Items cannot be placed on imagers by the DRC via the VaultManager we don't
have. So they would have to be added directly in the DB via SQL queries.
When this is done, the node containing the image/text must have the
createageuuid and createagename values set correctly. They should be set to
match those of the age the imager is in. If a node is being updated it is
probably best to update the modify timestamp as well but this is not as
critical as it was in UU.


Changing the game_data_dir by reloading the config file will *not* reload
the SDL/common files. If the game server was not enabled and then it is enabled
the files will be loaded; it's just that once loaded they are never reloaded.
