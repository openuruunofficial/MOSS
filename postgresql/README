To build with the PostgreSQL extension module build infrastructure, just
use:
	make
	make install

Otherwise, instructions for building by hand can be found at:
	http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/interactive/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC

If you are using 8.2 or earlier:
	create or replace function uuid() returns text as 'moss_uuidgen',
	'moss_uuidgen_text' language 'C' strict;

If you are using >= 8.3 *and* want a "uuid" type, use:
	create or replace function uuid() returns uuid as 'moss_uuidgen',
	'moss_uuidgen' language 'C' strict;

(The uuid() function is included in moss.sql so you don't need to install it
yourself. But you do still need to copy the new module into the DB install
and restart. All MOSS code assumes you are using the text version provided in
the moss.sql file, and not the "uuid" type, so don't change it unless you plan
to change all UUID-handling SQL and code.)
